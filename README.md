# Plotly Practice

### Requirements
Make sure to have pip installed locally. I suggest having pyenv installed, and python version 2.9.10 as it should have pip installed automatically.

You will need to install the dependencies for this to work. (ignore Requirement already satisfied messages)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To run program
```
python bin/graph
```
