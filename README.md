# Plotly Practice

### Requirements
Make sure to have pip installed locally. I suggest having pyenv installed, and python version 2.9.10 as it should have pip installed automatically.

You will need to install these dependencies for this to work.
```
pip install "ipython[notebook]"
pip install "plotly"
pip install "pandas"
pip install "xlrd"
```

### To run program
```
python bin/graph
```
